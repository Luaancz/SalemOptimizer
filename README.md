# SalemOptimizer
Proficiency learning optimizer tool. Simply select the inspirationals you have available, fill in the proficiencies you want, and hit Find. In a second or two, you will be presented with a few options to get the proficiencies you need, along with their total cost in Inspiration.

## Notes
This is a very simple optimizer based on genetic algorithms. It's na√Øve, it's wasteful and there's definitely a way to get to an optimal solution easier and more reliably. But I already had some GA code laying around, and adapting it for this task wasn't a lot of work, so there you go :)
